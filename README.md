# Bot-Detection
Twitter bot is a program used to produce automated posts, follow Twitter users or serve as spam to entice clicks on the Twitter microblogging service. In this project, I have used Machine Learning techniques to predict weather an account on Twitter is a Bot or a real user. I have performed significant amount of feature engineering, along with feature extraction - selected 16 features representing semantic content of tweets, content of tweets and profile of each account identify whether an account is bot or non bot. 
Utilised 2 datasets, Cresci 2017 datasets and TwitBot 20 datasets and compare each model performance against baseline of current-state-of-the-art for each dataset showcasing the impact of each
