# Bot-Detection
Twitter bot is a program used to produce automated posts, follow Twitter users or serve as spam to entice clicks on the Twitter microblogging service. In this project, I have used Machine Learning techniques to predict weather an account on Twitter is a Bot or a real user. I have performed significant amount of feature engineering, along with feature extraction - selected 16 features representing  to identify whether an account is bot or non bot.
